This is an optional part of the [65test](https://github.com/SolraBizna/65test) test suite, testing the .NET version of my cycle-accurate W65C02S core. To use, place `W65C02S-test.exe` and the dependent DLLs into a new folder `dotnetcore` in the `arsprove` folder of `65test`. Assuming my hardware test harness is working at a given moment, and the `arsprove` tests otherwise pass, this will test the .NET core against the full test suite. Batteries are decidedly not included here.
